      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>AngryBirds-inspired game</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a 2D physics-based game inspired by Angry Birds using Java,
          libGDX, and Box2D. Designed game entities (Bird, Pig, Block, Catapult,
          Level) with OOP principles and resolved circular dependencies to
          ensure smooth gameplay
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Byte Me! - CLI-based Food Ordering System</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a command-line food ordering system for the college canteen
          using Java. Features included menu management, order prioritization
          for VIP customers, real-time order tracking, and daily sales
          reporting. Utilized collections like ArrayList and TreeMap to organize
          and efficiently manage menu items, orders, and histories.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>University Course Registration System</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a terminal-based system to manage student enrollments,
          course schedules, academic progress, and administrative tasks using
          Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Process Scheduling Algorithm Project</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a process scheduling algorithm to efficiently manage task
          execution within an operating system. The project involved
          understanding key scheduling techniques, analyzing process behavior,
          and optimizing performance
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>RISC V ASSEMBLER AND SIMULATOR</h3>
        <p>
          A tool that translates RISC-V assembly code into machine code and
          simulates its execution, allowing users to test and debug programs in
          a controlled environment. It provides insights into the processor's
          behavior, such as register states and memory operations, without
          requiring physical hardware
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Full-Stack E-Commerce Database Design</h3>
        <p>
          Designed a full-stack e-commerce database system with ER modeling, SQL
          queries, and GUI integration using Flask and MySQL. Enabled smooth
          product management, order tracking, and customer interactions across
          categories.
